    "[Description of data analysis method described clearly - 10 points] Here we are using matplotlib to create a plot that will be printed out below. The x and y axes will be labeled based on the values in the list \"cpds\". The color bar is added, X and y axis ticks are added, and the plot is saved and displayed. Heatmaps are a data visualization technique for viewing the magnitude of phenomenon as a color out of a gradient of colors. Heatmaps are 2D graphs and can often be used to show the relative amount of a substance, or in this case, the similarity scores between all data points compared. This sort of plot could be used to compare the alignment scores between a set of sequences, and here it is used to compare the similarity scores between all compounds in a set."

    "[25 points for correctly analyzing the data] The plot above shows the similarities between all compounds in the set. The first ligand is the ligand that was identified from the protein data bank (PDB: 2OH4). The other compounds were downloaded from the PubChem. Compounds that are similar to one another have a higher FingerPrint Similarity score (closer to 1.0 & yellow) and those that are less similar to one another have a lower FingerPrint Similarity score (closer to 0.4 & purple). Each cell in the matrix represents a similarity score. The diagonal are all yellow because these are comparing the similarity between a compound and itself. There are three compounds that are more similar to one another, labeled 1, 2, 3 in the heatmap above. The remainder of compounds are less than 0.7 similarity and two compounds, are less that 0.5 tanimoto similarity to all the other compounds. If we look at the compounds structure, these similarities make sense in that each of these compounds have unique structure types. Yet despite this visual clustering, there are potent compounds (all with IC50s less than 0.01 uM) in both sets of compounds. Thus, my hypothesis was correct and there was not one cluster of compounds that was necessarily more potent than others."
